This test leverages SNMP-controlled, programmable power strips to validate that the driver, 
controller, and underlying device honor the appropriate flush command by persisting data to the device.

此測試會利用 SNMP控制的延長線來驗證受測Device再接收到Flush Command後，可以確保Device內儲存資料的完整性

1.Write a known pattern directly to disk (by-passing the file system) and wait for writes to complete.
2.Send Flush command and wait for completion.
3.Immediately trigger sudden power loss.
4.On reboot, read back and verify that all data that was written to disk before the flush command.
5.Repeat cycle with a different write scenario (different size, pattern, location, etc.).

1.選擇一種資料寫入的模式 資料寫入Disk內，並等待寫入完成
2.送出Flish Command
3.瞬間斷電
4.Reboot之後，讀回寫入的檔案並確認其完整性
5.進行下一次不同模式的測試


Running the test

1.  This test runs both on boot and non-boot controller compared to the older test which could only run on non-boot controller.
    This enables testing of both boot disks and data disks.
    For boot disk, the multithreaded scenarios are skipped, whereas for a data disk, all the scenarios are executed.

測試會使用開機碟與非開機碟(測試用的Storage Device)，但主要的多個Scenarios會於非開機碟上執行

2.  Setup required for the test: Connect a power distribution unit (PDU), controllable via SNMP, to the HLK test machine.

因測試需求 需要一條可由SNMP控制的電源延長線與HLK機器做連接

3.  Power strip should have a valid IP address associated as the test uses both the IP address and the port to initiate sudden power loss.

作為測試需要，延長線需要有一個IP位置以及Port，讓測試時可以透過這個Port來執行斷電

4.  Power strip can be connected locally/remotely to machine, please see power strip manual for configuration details.

延長線要可以透過本地端或是遠端連線到機器上

Power-strip

The test supports providing OID value for SNMP connections for a PDU. 
The default OID is set as .1.3.6.1.4.1.318.1.1.12.3.3.1.1.4 as it is the one that 
is used by APC and it can be changed when providing parameters to the test based on the OID of the PDU. 
The only limit as of now is the ASN value as mentioned below. Other PDU models should have the same ASN value.

ImmediatePowerOn = 1
ImmediatePowerOff = 2
ImmediateReboot = 3

此項測試支援會傳送一個OID的值給延長線裝置，Default的OID值為 .1.3.6.1.4.1.318.1.1.12.3.3.1.1.4
基本上OID的值是被APC拿來做使用的
OID的值也可以修改，透過測試用的PDU自己本身的OID值來做修改
唯一需要注意的是ASN的值不能修改，PDU的模組需要提供以下相同的ASN的值才可以

ImmediatePowerOn = 1
ImmediatePowerOff = 2
ImmediateReboot = 3

The test is known to support the APC and CPS PDUs with these ASN values and can be tested out with other PDUs
as well that supports configuration mentioned as above. 
To run the test, you will need the IP address of the power-strip.
Please refer to the power-strip user manual for information on how to discover the IP address.

這個測試是使用具有ASN的值的APC型或是CPS型的PDU來進行測試
可以參考power-strip user manual來看怎麼取得IP 

Sudden Power Loss and BIOS setting

Test runs about 21 scenarios initiating sudden power loss each time. 
When power-strip port is programmed for power off and delayed power on, 
systems may not power ON automatically as this is a BIOS setting and is usually available on desktop machines. 
Example: On HP Compaq DC7800 machine, In BIOS under Advanced->Power-On Options, there is a field called "After Power Loss", set it to ON.

For uninterrupted and automated way of running flush test, set the BIOS setting to power ON machine automatically 
when power is plugged in.

測試會進行21次斷電情境測試，程式經由延長線的port來執行斷電以及延長開機時間
機器可能不會自動開機，因為這個會和BIOS設定有關，且通常只可以在桌機上正常使用
如果發生這種情形，請在BIOS將自動power on功能開啟

Battery/Non-battery powered systems
Flush runs only on non-battery powered systems. If you are using a desktop machine, flush is applicable. 
If you are using a laptop machine (we assume battery is plugged in), flush is not applicable. 
Below are the options available for certifying devices against systems.


More information
These scenarios send a flush command to the device as soon as all outstanding I/O complete for a given scenario. Power loss occurs immediately after the flush command completes. If any data from the scenario did not persist to disk, the test will fail. The logo test will run each of these 21 scenarios.

1.Flush and Reboot after 512MB of Syncronous Sequential Writes
Small writes (512B - 4KB)
Large writes (768KB - 1MB)
Pseudorandom-sized writes (512B - 1MB)

2.Flush and Reboot after 512MB of Syncronous Random Writes
Small writes (512B - 4KB)
Large writes (768KB - 1MB)

3.Flush and Reboot after 512MB of Syncronous Striding Writes
Small writes (512B - 4KB)
